                    <p class="text">
                        Ghana’s improved sanitation coverage has not exceeded 15% in a long time. 
                        This means only 15 in every 100 Ghanaians have access to sanitation facilities and services. 
                        Based on this statistic, what we are experiencing with regards to sanitation and waste management 
                        is justified but the consequences on us is too dire to ignore. We don’t have the luxury of waiting 
                        until everything comes together for us to reverse this trend. Let’s reverse the trend by 
                        using resources currently at our disposal beginning with the ones highly overlooked, like, our concern for the environment.

                    You have a responsibility of keeping your environment clean but lack the power to decide how it should be treated by 
                    others yet that doesn’t prevent you from suffering the consequences of an ill-treated environment.

                    <br>
                    The solution is YOU, but we also know that you can’t do much without your tools so Tydizen is here to provide you with all the tools.
